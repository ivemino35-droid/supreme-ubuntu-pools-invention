      body: "Ubuntu Pools is a non-custodial Digital Aggregator that helps people coordinate Pools: family milestone savings, emergency reserves, collective purchasing, and community support. Funds remain with regulated partners or trusted third parties; Ubuntu Pools focuses on rules, transparency, and trust."

      heading: "What Ubuntu Pools Is Not",
      body: "Ubuntu Pools is not a bank, lender, insurer, investment manager, collective investment scheme, or guarantor of returns. Ubuntu Pools does not promise yield or profit."

    {
      heading: "Trust Is Our Currency",
      body: "Trust is earned through behavior over time. Trust on Ubuntu Pools is contextual, visible, and governed collectively. Trust cannot be sold or traded. It exists to protect participants—not to exploit them."

    {
      heading: "Governance Before Growth",
      body: "Every Pool is governed by a Digital Constitution agreed by members: contribution rules, voting and approvals, emergency overrides, exits, and dispute processes. Ubuntu Pools enforces process, not power."
